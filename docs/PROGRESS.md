## Prompt 0b — Fix vendor binary pipeline (2026-10-15)

Fixed broken setup scripts and established a durable vendor-binary mirror:

- `scripts/setup.ps1` — rewrote FFmpeg section: replaced broken gyan.dev (GPL) URL with BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds LGPL builds for Windows x64 and ARM64; real SHA-256 checksums; architecture auto-detection; LGPL verification (`ffmpeg -version` asserts no `--enable-gpl`, no `--enable-version3`); clear error messages naming file + URL on any failure.
- `scripts/setup.sh` — updated ExifTool to SourceForge mirror (exiftool.org now redirects); macOS FFmpeg section replaced with an explicit deferred stub pending a custom LGPL compile workflow.
- Created GitHub Release `vendor-binaries-v1` at `aelkays-hub/keepsake/releases/tag/vendor-binaries-v1` containing all four pinned assets: FFmpeg n9.0 LGPL win64, FFmpeg n9.0 LGPL winarm64, ExifTool 13.59 Windows 64-bit, ExifTool 13.59 Unix tarball. All SHA-256s verified against upstream sources.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` ADR-005 — updated with BtbN as the authoritative FFmpeg source, full SHA-256 checksums, mirror URL, and notes on the deferred macOS LGPL compile workflow.

Created the full repository skeleton:

- `CLAUDE.md` — engineering guide with product description, non-negotiables, stack, layout, conventions, commands, and definition of done.
- `docs/SPEC.md` — feature specification across MVP, v1, and v2.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — components, data model, Sony card layouts, capture-date precedence, ingest pipeline.
- `docs/DECISIONS.md` — ADRs 001–006.
- `docs/PROGRESS.md` — this file.
- Cargo workspace with `keepsake-core`, `keepsake-platform`, `keepsake-cli`.
- `app/src-tauri` — Tauri 2 app showing version on placeholder screen.
- `app/ui` — React 18 + TypeScript + Vite scaffold.
- `scripts/setup.sh` and `scripts/setup.ps1` — idempotent dev-environment setup.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — matrix CI for `windows-latest` and `macos-14`.
- `TEST_ME.md` — manual test steps for the bootstrap build.
- Branch `bootstrap`, PR opened.
